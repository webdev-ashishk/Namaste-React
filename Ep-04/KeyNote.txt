Q1: Map ?
A: Whenever used map method You must used key 

Q2: Why we used key ?
A: Lets when we have not used key in map whats happens
  1] When we 1 container containts 2 cart 
    then new cart added then react don't no how much cart we need to render then react re-rendered all carts.
  2] When we have 1 Container contains 10lack carts
  then new cart added then react doesn't now where cart added then react re-rendered all 10lack component make application little bit slower 

  Q=>what is solution of this problem ?
  A: You used key whenever used .map()  

  Whenever we give unique key all elements then react know which component is added new and rendered only one component instead of re-rendering all components thats make my appliction more faster then previous version

Q3: React say never used index as key 
A: But whenever You api have not key then used index as key.
 
 if possible talk to backend developer and told add unique key if possible
